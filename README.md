# Rails API Project

## Setup

First **fork** and *then* clone this repository.

`cd` into the folder you just cloned and run the following commands:

    bundle install

    rails server

If it worked, you should be able to navigate to [http://localhost:3000] and see something there. If it didn't work, make sure you don't have any old servers running in other tabs or windows.
